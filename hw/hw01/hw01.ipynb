    "\n",

    "### Detailed Submission Instructions Are Provided at the end of this Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment Scope:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate Jupyter notebooks (like this one);\n",
    "2. Write and evaluate some basic *expressions* in Python, the computer language of the course;\n",
    "3. Practice with basic  *functions*\n",
    "4. Practice with the NumPy module\n",
    "5. Review prerequisite topics from Calculus and Discrete Structures\n",
    "6. Complete the course Welcome Survey\n",

    "## Collaboration Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science is a collaborative activity.  However a key step in learning and retention is **creating solutions on your own.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Below are examples of acceptable vs unacceptable use of resources and collaboration when doing HW assignments in CSCI 3022.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following would be some **examples of cheating** when working on HW assignments in CSCI 3022.  Any of these constitute a **violation of the course's collaboration policy and will result in an F in the course and a trip to the honor council**.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Consulting web pages that may have a solution to a given homework problem or one similar is cheating.  However, consulting the class notes, and web pages that explain the material taught in class but do NOT show a solution to the homework problem in question are permissible to view.  Clearly, there's a fuzzy line here between a valid use of resources and cheating. To avoid this line, one should merely consult the course notes, the course textbook, and references that contain syntax and/or formulas.\n",
    " - Copying a segment of code or math solution of three lines or more from another student from a printout, handwritten copy, or by looking at their computer screen \n",
    " - Allowing another student to copy a segment of your code or math solution of three lines or more\n",
    " - Taking a copy of another student's work (or a solution found online) and then editing that copy\n",
    " - Reading someone else’s solution to a problem on the HW before writing your own.\n",
    " - Asking someone to write all or part of a program or solution for you.\n",
    " - Asking someone else for the code necessary to fix the error for you, other than for simple syntactical errors\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the following are some **examples of things which would NOT usually be\n",
    "considered to be cheating**:\n",
    " - Working on a HW problem on your own first and then discussing with a classmate a particular part in the problem solution where you are stuck.  After clarifying any questions you should then continue to write your solution independently.\n",
    " - Asking someone (or searching online) how a particular construct in the language works.\n",
    " - Asking someone (or searching online) how to formulate a particular construct in the language.\n",
    " - Asking someone for help in finding an error in your program.  \n",
    " - Asking someone why a particular construct does not work as you expected in a given program.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "To test whether you are truly doing your own work and retaining what you've learned you should be able to easily reproduce from scratch and explain a HW solution that was your own when asked in office hours by a TA/Instructor or on a quiz/exam.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have difficulty in formulating the general solution to a problem on your own, or\n",
    "you have difficulty in translating that general solution into a program, it is advisable to see\n",
    "your instructor or teaching assistant rather than another student as this situation can easily\n",
    "lead to a, possibly inadvertent, cheating situation.\n",

    "NumPy’s arrays are homogeneous: an array can only contain data of a single type. For instance, an array can contain 8-bit integers or 32-bit floating point numbers, but not a mix of the two. This is in stark contrast to Python’s lists and tuples, which are entirely unrestricted in the variety of contents they can possess; a given list could simultaneously contain strings, integers, and other objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "This restriction on an array’s contents comes at a great benefit; in “knowing” that an array’s contents are homogeneous in data type, NumPy is able to delegate the task of performing mathematical operations on the array’s contents to optimized, compiled C code. This is a process that is referred to as **vectorization**. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Definition**:  In the context of a high-level languages like Python, the **term vectorization** describes the use of optimized, pre-compiled code written in a low-level language (e.g. C) to **perform mathematical operations over a sequence of data. This is done in place of an explicit iteration written in the native language code (e.g. a “for-loop” written in Python).**\n",
