    "## Assignment Learning Objectives\n",
    " - Recognize when to use Bernoulli and Binomial Random Variables\n",
    " - Explain the difference between Probabilty Density Functions (PDFs) and Cumulative Density Functions (CDFs) and use both to calculate probabilities for continuous random variables\n",
    " - Know the PDF for a Uniform continuous random variable and use it to calculate probabilities\n",
    " - Know the PDF for an exponential continuous random variable and use it to calculate probabilities\n",
    " - Know the PDF for a normal continuous random variable and use it to calculate probabilities\n",

    "Below are examples of acceptable vs unacceptable use of resources and collaboration when doing HW assignments in CSCI 3022.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following would be some **examples of cheating** when working on HW assignments in CSCI 3022.  Any of these constitute a **violation of the course's collaboration policy and will result in an F in the course and a trip to the honor council**.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Consulting web pages that may have a solution to a given homework problem or one similar is cheating.  However, consulting the class notes, and web pages that explain the material taught in class but do NOT show a solution to the homework problem in question are permissible to view.  Clearly, there's a fuzzy line here between a valid use of resources and cheating. To avoid this line, one should merely consult the course notes, the course textbook, and references that contain syntax and/or formulas.\n",
    " - Copying a segment of code or math solution of three lines or more from another student from a printout, handwritten copy, or by looking at their computer screen \n",
    " - Allowing another student to copy a segment of your code or math solution of three lines or more\n",
    " - Taking a copy of another student's work (or a solution found online) and then editing that copy\n",
    " - Reading someone elseâ€™s solution to a problem on the HW before writing your own.\n",
    " - Asking someone to write all or part of a program or solution for you.\n",
    " - Asking someone else for the code necessary to fix the error for you, other than for simple syntactical errors\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the following are some **examples of things which would NOT usually be\n",
    "considered to be cheating**:\n",
    " - Working on a HW problem on your own first and then discussing with a classmate a particular part in the problem solution where you are stuck.  After clarifying any questions you should then continue to write your solution independently.\n",
    " - Asking someone (or searching online) how a particular construct in the language works.\n",
    " - Asking someone (or searching online) how to formulate a particular construct in the language.\n",
    " - Asking someone for help in finding an error in your program.  \n",
    " - Asking someone why a particular construct does not work as you expected in a given program.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "To test whether you are truly doing your own work and retaining what you've learned you should be able to easily reproduce from scratch and explain a HW solution that was your own when asked in office hours by a TA/Instructor or on a quiz/exam.   \n",
    "\n",

    "If you have difficulty in formulating the general solution to a problem on your own, or\n",
    "you have difficulty in translating that general solution into a program, it is advisable to see\n",
